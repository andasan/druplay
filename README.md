## Overview

This Drupal Playground project provides a development environment for experimenting with Drupal using modern tools and practices. It leverages Composer as a module package manager, DDEV for local development, and Docker for containerization. Whether you're new to Drupal or an experienced developer, this playground can be a valuable resource for testing ideas, modules, or themes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started with this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/): The PHP dependency manager used for Drupal modules and dependencies.
- [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): A Docker-based local development environment.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): A containerization platform for building, shipping, and running applications.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
   git clone https://github.com/andasan/drupal-playground.git
   cd drupal-playground
```

2. Install project dependencies using Composer:
